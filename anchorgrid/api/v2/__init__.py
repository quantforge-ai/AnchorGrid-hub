"""AnchorGrid API v2 - Future Routes

This directory is reserved for v2 API routes.
When breaking changes are needed, new routes should be added here.

Migration Path:
1. Implement new routes in v2/
2. Deprecate v1 routes with warnings
3. Remove v1 routes after 6 months

Example:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/example")
async def example_v2():
    return {"version": "2.0", "message": "New v2 endpoint"}
```
